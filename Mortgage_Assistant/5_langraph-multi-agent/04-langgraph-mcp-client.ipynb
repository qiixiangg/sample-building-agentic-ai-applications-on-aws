    "## Introduction\n",
    "Before we jump into the deep end of the MCP world, lets go through the key concepts. `Model Context Protocol (MCP)` an open standard protocol developed at Anthropic, standardises how your LLM connects to the differnt tools and data sources. MCP borrows its ideas from REST APIs (standardised how web apps interact with backend) and LSPs (standardised how IDEs interact with language specific tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "With MCP, developer responsibilities can be isolated. Developers can build LLM applications (clients) and re-use connectors (servers) as opposed to building the custom connectors\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP is built based on client - host - server architecture.  has 3 key components\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Host \n",
    "It can be any IDEs, tools that want to access the data through MCP. Each Host can run multiple clients. Think of host like a container\n",
    "##### Client\n",
    "Each client maintains 1:1 relationship with the server\n",
    "##### Server\n",
    "Servers provide context to the LLMs by exposing `tools`,`resources` and `prompts`  \n",
    "Tools are used for execution (like a `POST` request) Resources are used for `get` information\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP server has two variations, you can either use FastMCP or write the server implementation from scratch using MCPServer\n",
    "\n",
    "FastMCP - higher level construct that abstracts most of the boiler plate code of MCPServer, provides simplified APIs for tools, resources and prompts. It also handles the HTTP transports, manages authentication\n"

Historically, the rule of thumb is that refinancing is a good idea if you can reduce your interest rate by at least 2%. However, many lenders say 1% savings is enough of an incentive to refinance. Using a [mortgage calculator is a good resource to budget some of the costs. Reducing your interest rate not only helps you save money, but it also increases the rate at which you build equity in your home, and it can decrease the size of your monthly payment. For example, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of 5.5% on a $100,000 home has a principal and interest payment of $568. That same loan at 4.1% reduces your payment to $477. ### Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think you've been discriminated against](https://www.investopedia.com/housing-discrimination-what-can-you-do-5074478) based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. One such step is to file a report to the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/) or with the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. ## Refinancing to Shorten the Loan's Term When interest rates fall, homeowners sometimes have the opportunity to refinance an existing loan for another loan that, without much change in the monthly payment, has a significantly shorter term. For a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage on a $100,000 home, refinancing from 9% to 5.5% can cut the term in half to 15 years with only a slight change in the monthly payment from $805 to $817. However, if you're already at 5.5% for 30 years ($568), getting, a 3.5% mortgage for 15 years would raise your payment to $715.\"),\n",

While these arguments may be true, increasing the number of years that you owe on your mortgage is rarely a smart financial decision nor is spending a dollar on interest to get a 30-cent tax deduction. Also note that since the Tax Cut and Jobs Act went into effect, the size of the loan on which you can deduct interest has dropped from $1 million to $750,000 if you bought your house after Dec. 15, 2017. Many homeowners refinance to consolidate their debt. At face value, replacing high-interest debt with a low-interest mortgage is a good idea. Unfortunately, refinancing does not bring automatic financial prudence. Take this step only if you are convinced you can resist the temptation to spend once the refinancing relieves you from debt. Be aware that a large percentage of people who once generated high-interest debt on credit cards, cars, and other purchases will simply do it again after the mortgage refinancing gives them the available credit to do so. This creates an instant quadruple loss composed of wasted fees on the refinancing, lost equity in the house, additional years of increased interest payments on the new mortgage, and the return of high-interest debt once the credit cards are maxed out again---the possible result is an endless perpetuation of the debt cycle and eventual bankruptcy. Another reason to refinance can be a serious financial emergency. If that is the case, carefully research all your options](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/101315/7-smart-ways-raise-cash-fast.asp) for raising funds before you take this step. If you do a cash-out refinance, you may be [charged a higher interest rate on the new mortgage than for a rate-and-term refinance, in which you don't take out money. ## The Bottom Line Refinancing can be a great financial move if it reduces your mortgage payment, shortens the term of your loan, or helps you build equity more quickly. When used carefully, it can also be a valuable tool for bringing debt under control. Before you refinance, take a careful look at your financial situation and ask yourself: How long do I plan to continue living in the house? How much money will I save by refinancing? Again, keep in mind that refinancing costs 3% to 6% of the loan's principal.\"),\n",

There are many reasons why homeowners refinance: * To obtain a lower interest rate * To shorten the term of their mortgage * To convert from an adjustable-rate mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp) (ARM) to a [fixed-rate mortgage, or vice versa * To tap into home equity to raise funds to deal with a financial emergency, finance a large purchase, or consolidate debt Since refinancing can cost between 3% and 6% of a loan\\'s principal and---as with an original mortgage---requires an appraisal, title search, and application fees, it\\'s important for a homeowner to determine whether refinancing is a wise financial decision. ### Key Takeaways * Getting a mortgage with a lower interest rate is one of the best reasons to refinance. * When interest rates drop, consider refinancing to shorten the term of your mortgage and pay significantly less in interest payments. * Switching to a fixed-rate mortgage---or to an adjustable-rate one---can make sense depending on the rates and how long you plan to remain in your current home. * Tapping equity or consolidating debt are other reasons to refinance---but beware, doing so can sometimes worsen debt problems. ### Is Refinancing Worth It? A rule of thumb says that you\\'ll benefit from refinancing if the new rate is at least 1% lower than the rate you have. More to the point, consider whether the monthly savings is enough to make a positive change in your life, or whether the overall savings over the life of the loan will benefit you substantially. ## Refinancing to Secure a Lower Interest Rate One of the best reasons to refinance is to lower the interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/080713/how-banks-set-interest-rates-your-loans.asp) on your existing loan.'),\n",

However, if you're already at 5.5% for 30 years ($568), getting, a 3.5% mortgage for 15 years would raise your payment to $715. So do the math and see what works. ## Refinancing to Convert to an ARM or Fixed-Rate Mortgage While ARMs often start out offering lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages, periodic adjustments can result in rate increases that are higher than the rate available through a fixed-rate mortgage. When this occurs, converting to fixed-rate mortgage results in a lower interest rate and eliminates concern over future interest rate hikes. Conversely, converting from a fixed-rate loan to an ARM---which often has a lower monthly payment than a fixed-term mortgage---can be a sound financial strategy if interest rates are falling, especially for homeowners who do not play to stay in their homes for more than a few years. These homeowners can reduce their loan's interest rate and monthly payment, but they will not have to worry about how higher rates go 30 years in the future. If rates continue to fall, the periodic rate adjustments on an ARM result in decreasing rates and smaller monthly mortgage payments eliminating the need to refinance every time rates drop. When mortgage interest rates rise, on the other hand, this would be an unwise strategy. ## Refinancing to Tap Equity or Consolidate Debt While the previously mentioned reasons to refinance are all financially sound, mortgage refinancing can be a slippery slope to never-ending debt. Homeowners often access the equity in their homes to cover major expenses, such as the costs of home remodeling or a child's college education. These homeowners may justify the refinancing by the fact that remodeling adds value to the home or that the interest rate on the mortgage loan is less than the rate on money borrowed from another source. Another justification is that the interest on mortgages is tax-deductible. While these arguments may be true, increasing the number of years that you owe on your mortgage is rarely a smart financial decision nor is spending a dollar on interest to get a 30-cent tax deduction.\")]"

While a 30-year mortgage can make your monthly payments more affordable, a 15-year mortgage generally costs less in the long run. Most homebuyers choose a 30-year home loan. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is practically an American archetype, the apple pie of financial instruments. It is the path that generations of Americans have taken to first-time homeownership. But many of those buyers might have been better served if they had opted for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage instead. Though the monthly payments might be higher, they could save thousands in interest. ### Key Takeaways * Most homebuyers choose a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but a 15-year mortgage can be a good choice for some. * A 30-year mortgage can make your monthly payments more affordable. * While monthly payments on a 15-year mortgage are higher, the cost of the loan is less in the long run. ## How Mortgage Terms Affect Cost A mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) is simply a particular type of term loan---one secured by real property. For a term loan, the borrower pays interest calculated on an annual basis against the outstanding balance of the loan. Both the [interest rate and monthly payment are fixed. Because the monthly payment is fixed, the portion going to pay interest and the portion going to pay principal change over time. In the beginning, because the loan balance is so high, most of the payment is interest. But as the balance gets smaller, the interest share of the payment declines, and the share going to principal increases. A shorter-term loan means a higher monthly payment, which makes the 15-year mortgage seem less affordable. But the shorter term makes the loan cheaper on several fronts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The better choice is the one that works best with your finances and long-term goals. ## Is It Better to Get a 15-Year Mortgage or Make Extra Payments on a 30-Year Mortgage? Applying extra payments toward your principal can help you pay down a 30-year mortgage faster without being locked in to a 15-year time frame. Run the numbers to decide whether the flexibility will be worth it, since 30-year loans often come with higher interest rates. ## Is It Worth It to Switch From a 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage to a 15-Year? If you already have a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and are interested in refinancing to a 15-year mortgage, there are a couple key points to keep in mind. First, consider whether your budget can accommodate the higher mortgage payment of a 15-year loan. Then, compare your existing interest rate with the rates you qualify for on a 15-year mortgage. If you can get a lower interest rate, that could save you money. But with a refinance, you also have to consider the costs of the new loan, which could include origination fees, closing costs, and other expenses. If you don't come out ahead after factoring in the new interest rate as well as the costs of the new loan, you might choose to make extra payments on your existing loan instead. ## The Bottom Line The decision between a 30-year or 15-year mortgage is one that will impact your finances for decades to come, so be sure to crunch the numbers before deciding which is best. If your aim is to pay off the mortgage sooner and you can afford higher monthly payments, a 15-year loan might be a better choice. The lower monthly payment of a 30-year loan, on the other hand, may allow you to buy more house or free up funds for other financial goals.

      "But as the balance gets smaller, the interest share of the payment declines, and the share going to principal increases. A shorter-term loan means a higher monthly payment, which makes the 15-year mortgage seem less affordable. But the shorter term makes the loan cheaper on several fronts. In fact, over the full life of a loan, a 30-year mortgage will end up costing more than double the 15-year option. ### Because 15-year loans are less risky for banks than 30-year loans---and because it costs banks less to make shorter-term loans than longer-term loans---a 30-year mortgage typically comes with a higher interest rate. ## 30-Year Mortgage In a 30-year mortgage, of course, that balance shrinks much more slowly---effectively, the homebuyer is borrowing the same amount of money for more than twice as long. In fact, it's more than twice as long rather than just twice as long because, for a 30-year mortgage, the principal balance does not decline as fast as it does for a 15-year loan. The higher the interest rate, the greater the gap between the two mortgages. When the interest rate is 4%, for example, the borrower actually pays almost 2.2 times more interest to borrow the same amount of principal over 30 years compared with a 15-year loan. The chief advantage of a 30-year mortgage is the relatively low monthly payment. And even if affordability isn't an issue, there are other advantages: * The lower payment may allow a borrower to buy more house than they would be able to afford with a 15-year loan since the same monthly payment would allow the borrower to take out a larger loan over 30 years. * The lower payment allows a borrower to build up savings. * The lower payment frees up funds for other goals. Comparison shopping among the best mortgage lenders can help you narrow your options. ## 15-Year Mortgage Consumers pay less on a 15-year mortgage---anywhere from a quarter of a percent to a full percent (or point) less, and over the decades that can really add up. The government-supported agencies that back most mortgages, such as Fannie Mae ](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/fannie-mae-loans/)and [Freddie Mac, impose additional fees, called loan-level price adjustments, which make 30-year mortgages more expensive.\n",

      "\"Currently there are no fixed-income investments that would yield a high enough return to make this work,\" says Shah. Rising mortgage rates can make this method even more difficult. The risk might not always pay off if it coincides with the kind of sharp stock market drops that occurred during the downturn of 2020. It also requires the discipline to systematically invest the equivalent of those monthly differentials and the time to focus on the investments, which, he adds, most people lack. ### Private mortgage insurance is required by lenders when you put a down payment that's less than 20% of the value of the home. ## A Best-of-Both-Worlds Option Most borrowers evidently also lack---or at least think they lack---the wherewithal to make the higher payments required by a 15-year mortgage. But there is a simple solution to capture much of the savings of the shorter mortgage: Simply make the larger payments of a 15-year schedule on your 30-year mortgage, assuming the mortgage has no prepayment penalty. A borrower is entitled to direct the extra payments to the principal, and if the payments are consistent, the mortgage will be paid off in 15 years. If times get tight, the borrower can always fall back to the normal, lower payments of the 30-year schedule. However, a borrower accelerating payments will also have their interest subject to the relatively higher 30-year rate when they may have been better off paying the mortgage off in 15 years anyhow at the lower rate offered on the shorter loan. ## Which Is Better, a 30-Year Mortgage or a 15-Year Mortgage? When deciding between a 30-year and a 15-year mortgage, consider your circumstances. Do you need the flexibility of smaller payments, such as what you'd get with a 30-year loan? Or are you focused on the bottom line, and the interest savings you could get with a 15-year loan? Can you afford to make bigger monthly payments, or do you need room in your budget for other goals? The better choice is the one that works best with your finances and long-term goals. ## Is It Better to Get a 15-Year Mortgage or Make Extra Payments on a 30-Year Mortgage? Applying extra payments toward your principal can help you pay down a 30-year mortgage faster without being locked in to a 15-year time frame.\n",

      "Comparison shopping among the best mortgage lenders can help you narrow your options. ## 15-Year Mortgage Consumers pay less on a 15-year mortgage---anywhere from a quarter of a percent to a full percent (or point) less, and over the decades that can really add up. The government-supported agencies that back most mortgages, such as Fannie Mae ](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/fannie-mae-loans/)and [Freddie Mac, impose additional fees, called loan-level price adjustments, which make 30-year mortgages more expensive. These fees typically apply to borrowers with lower credit scores](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_score.asp), smaller down payments, or both. The [Federal Housing Administration also charges higher mortgage insurance premiums to 30-year borrowers. ### Important Upfront fees on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac home loans changed in May 2023. Fees were increased for homebuyers with higher credit scores, such as 740 or higher, while they were decreased for homebuyers with lower credit scores, such as those below 640. Another change: Your down payment will influence what your fee is. The higher your down payment, the lower your fees, though it will still depend on your credit score. Fannie Mae provides the Loan-Level Price Adjustments on its website. \"Some of the loan-level price adjustments that exist on a 30-year do not exist on a 15-year,\" says James Morin, senior vice president of retail lending at Norcom Mortgage in Avon, Conn. Most people, according to Morin, roll these costs into their mortgage as part of a higher rate, rather than paying them outright. Imagine, then, a $300,000 loan, available at 4% for 30 years or at 3.25% for 15 years. The combined effect of the faster amortization and the lower interest rate means that borrowing the money for just 15 years would cost $79,441, compared to $215,609 over 30 years, or nearly two-thirds less. Of course, there's a catch. The price for saving so much money over the long run is a much higher monthly outlay---the payment on the hypothetical 15-year loan is $2,108, $676 (or about 38%) more than the monthly payment for the 30-year loan ($1,432).\n",
      "\n",
      "For a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage on a $100,000 home, refinancing from 9% to 5.5% can cut the term in half to 15 years with only a slight change in the monthly payment from $805 to $817. However, if you're already at 5.5% for 30 years ($568), getting, a 3.5% mortgage for 15 years would raise your payment to $715. So do the math and see what works. ## Refinancing to Convert to an ARM or Fixed-Rate Mortgage While ARMs often start out offering lower rates than fixed-rate mortgages, periodic adjustments can result in rate increases that are higher than the rate available through a fixed-rate mortgage. When this occurs, converting to fixed-rate mortgage results in a lower interest rate and eliminates concern over future interest rate hikes. Conversely, converting from a fixed-rate loan to an ARM---which often has a lower monthly payment than a fixed-term mortgage---can be a sound financial strategy if interest rates are falling, especially for homeowners who do not play to stay in their homes for more than a few years. These homeowners can reduce their loan's interest rate and monthly payment, but they will not have to worry about how higher rates go 30 years in the future. If rates continue to fall, the periodic rate adjustments on an ARM result in decreasing rates and smaller monthly mortgage payments eliminating the need to refinance every time rates drop. When mortgage interest rates rise, on the other hand, this would be an unwise strategy. ## Refinancing to Tap Equity or Consolidate Debt While the previously mentioned reasons to refinance are all financially sound, mortgage refinancing can be a slippery slope to never-ending debt. Homeowners often access the equity in their homes to cover major expenses, such as the costs of home remodeling or a child's college education. These homeowners may justify the refinancing by the fact that remodeling adds value to the home or that the interest rate on the mortgage loan is less than the rate on money borrowed from another source. Another justification is that the interest on mortgages is tax-deductible. While these arguments may be true, increasing the number of years that you owe on your mortgage is rarely a smart financial decision nor is spending a dollar on interest to get a 30-cent tax deduction.\n",

While a 30-year mortgage can make your monthly payments more affordable, a 15-year mortgage generally costs less in the long run. Most homebuyers choose a 30-year home loan. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is practically an American archetype, the apple pie of financial instruments. It is the path that generations of Americans have taken to first-time homeownership. But many of those buyers might have been better served if they had opted for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage instead. Though the monthly payments might be higher, they could save thousands in interest. ### Key Takeaways * Most homebuyers choose a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but a 15-year mortgage can be a good choice for some. * A 30-year mortgage can make your monthly payments more affordable. * While monthly payments on a 15-year mortgage are higher, the cost of the loan is less in the long run. ## How Mortgage Terms Affect Cost A mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) is simply a particular type of term loan---one secured by real property. For a term loan, the borrower pays interest calculated on an annual basis against the outstanding balance of the loan. Both the [interest rate and monthly payment are fixed. Because the monthly payment is fixed, the portion going to pay interest and the portion going to pay principal change over time. In the beginning, because the loan balance is so high, most of the payment is interest. But as the balance gets smaller, the interest share of the payment declines, and the share going to principal increases. A shorter-term loan means a higher monthly payment, which makes the 15-year mortgage seem less affordable. But the shorter term makes the loan cheaper on several fronts.\n",

      "The better choice is the one that works best with your finances and long-term goals. ## Is It Better to Get a 15-Year Mortgage or Make Extra Payments on a 30-Year Mortgage? Applying extra payments toward your principal can help you pay down a 30-year mortgage faster without being locked in to a 15-year time frame. Run the numbers to decide whether the flexibility will be worth it, since 30-year loans often come with higher interest rates. ## Is It Worth It to Switch From a 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage to a 15-Year? If you already have a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and are interested in refinancing to a 15-year mortgage, there are a couple key points to keep in mind. First, consider whether your budget can accommodate the higher mortgage payment of a 15-year loan. Then, compare your existing interest rate with the rates you qualify for on a 15-year mortgage. If you can get a lower interest rate, that could save you money. But with a refinance, you also have to consider the costs of the new loan, which could include origination fees, closing costs, and other expenses. If you don't come out ahead after factoring in the new interest rate as well as the costs of the new loan, you might choose to make extra payments on your existing loan instead. ## The Bottom Line The decision between a 30-year or 15-year mortgage is one that will impact your finances for decades to come, so be sure to crunch the numbers before deciding which is best. If your aim is to pay off the mortgage sooner and you can afford higher monthly payments, a 15-year loan might be a better choice. The lower monthly payment of a 30-year loan, on the other hand, may allow you to buy more house or free up funds for other financial goals.

While a 30-year mortgage can make your monthly payments more affordable, a 15-year mortgage generally costs less in the long run. Most homebuyers choose a 30-year home loan. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is practically an American archetype, the apple pie of financial instruments. It is the path that generations of Americans have taken to first-time homeownership. But many of those buyers might have been better served if they had opted for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage instead. Though the monthly payments might be higher, they could save thousands in interest. ### Key Takeaways * Most homebuyers choose a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but a 15-year mortgage can be a good choice for some. * A 30-year mortgage can make your monthly payments more affordable. * While monthly payments on a 15-year mortgage are higher, the cost of the loan is less in the long run. ## How Mortgage Terms Affect Cost A mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) is simply a particular type of term loan---one secured by real property. For a term loan, the borrower pays interest calculated on an annual basis against the outstanding balance of the loan. Both the [interest rate and monthly payment are fixed. Because the monthly payment is fixed, the portion going to pay interest and the portion going to pay principal change over time. In the beginning, because the loan balance is so high, most of the payment is interest. But as the balance gets smaller, the interest share of the payment declines, and the share going to principal increases. A shorter-term loan means a higher monthly payment, which makes the 15-year mortgage seem less affordable. But the shorter term makes the loan cheaper on several fronts.\n",

      "\"Currently there are no fixed-income investments that would yield a high enough return to make this work,\" says Shah. Rising mortgage rates can make this method even more difficult. The risk might not always pay off if it coincides with the kind of sharp stock market drops that occurred during the downturn of 2020. It also requires the discipline to systematically invest the equivalent of those monthly differentials and the time to focus on the investments, which, he adds, most people lack. ### Private mortgage insurance is required by lenders when you put a down payment that's less than 20% of the value of the home. ## A Best-of-Both-Worlds Option Most borrowers evidently also lack---or at least think they lack---the wherewithal to make the higher payments required by a 15-year mortgage. But there is a simple solution to capture much of the savings of the shorter mortgage: Simply make the larger payments of a 15-year schedule on your 30-year mortgage, assuming the mortgage has no prepayment penalty. A borrower is entitled to direct the extra payments to the principal, and if the payments are consistent, the mortgage will be paid off in 15 years. If times get tight, the borrower can always fall back to the normal, lower payments of the 30-year schedule. However, a borrower accelerating payments will also have their interest subject to the relatively higher 30-year rate when they may have been better off paying the mortgage off in 15 years anyhow at the lower rate offered on the shorter loan. ## Which Is Better, a 30-Year Mortgage or a 15-Year Mortgage? When deciding between a 30-year and a 15-year mortgage, consider your circumstances. Do you need the flexibility of smaller payments, such as what you'd get with a 30-year loan? Or are you focused on the bottom line, and the interest savings you could get with a 15-year loan? Can you afford to make bigger monthly payments, or do you need room in your budget for other goals? The better choice is the one that works best with your finances and long-term goals. ## Is It Better to Get a 15-Year Mortgage or Make Extra Payments on a 30-Year Mortgage? Applying extra payments toward your principal can help you pay down a 30-year mortgage faster without being locked in to a 15-year time frame.\n",

      "But as the balance gets smaller, the interest share of the payment declines, and the share going to principal increases. A shorter-term loan means a higher monthly payment, which makes the 15-year mortgage seem less affordable. But the shorter term makes the loan cheaper on several fronts. In fact, over the full life of a loan, a 30-year mortgage will end up costing more than double the 15-year option. ### Because 15-year loans are less risky for banks than 30-year loans---and because it costs banks less to make shorter-term loans than longer-term loans---a 30-year mortgage typically comes with a higher interest rate. ## 30-Year Mortgage In a 30-year mortgage, of course, that balance shrinks much more slowly---effectively, the homebuyer is borrowing the same amount of money for more than twice as long. In fact, it's more than twice as long rather than just twice as long because, for a 30-year mortgage, the principal balance does not decline as fast as it does for a 15-year loan. The higher the interest rate, the greater the gap between the two mortgages. When the interest rate is 4%, for example, the borrower actually pays almost 2.2 times more interest to borrow the same amount of principal over 30 years compared with a 15-year loan. The chief advantage of a 30-year mortgage is the relatively low monthly payment. And even if affordability isn't an issue, there are other advantages: * The lower payment may allow a borrower to buy more house than they would be able to afford with a 15-year loan since the same monthly payment would allow the borrower to take out a larger loan over 30 years. * The lower payment allows a borrower to build up savings. * The lower payment frees up funds for other goals. Comparison shopping among the best mortgage lenders can help you narrow your options. ## 15-Year Mortgage Consumers pay less on a 15-year mortgage---anywhere from a quarter of a percent to a full percent (or point) less, and over the decades that can really add up. The government-supported agencies that back most mortgages, such as Fannie Mae ](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/fannie-mae-loans/)and [Freddie Mac, impose additional fees, called loan-level price adjustments, which make 30-year mortgages more expensive.\n",
