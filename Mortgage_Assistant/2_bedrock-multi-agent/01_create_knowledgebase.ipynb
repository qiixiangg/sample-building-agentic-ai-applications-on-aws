      "A 15-year and 30-year mortgage differ primarily in their loan term and monthly payment structure. The 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments but costs significantly less in total interest over the life of the loan. In contrast, a 30-year mortgage offers lower monthly payments, making it more affordable for many homebuyers, but results in paying almost double the total interest compared to a 15-year mortgage. With a 15-year mortgage, borrowers typically pay a lower interest rate, sometimes up to a full percentage point less than a 30-year loan. The shorter term means that more of each payment goes toward the principal earlier, helping homeowners build equity faster. Banks also consider 15-year loans less risky, which contributes to the lower interest rates. The primary advantage of a 30-year mortgage is flexibility. Lower monthly payments allow borrowers to potentially buy a more expensive home, build savings, or allocate funds to other financial goals. However, this comes at the cost of paying significantly more interest over time. For instance, at a 4% interest rate, borrowers will pay about 2.2 times more interest with a 30-year loan compared to a 15-year loan. The best choice depends on individual financial circumstances. If you can afford higher monthly payments and want to minimize long-term interest costs, a 15-year mortgage might be ideal. If you need lower monthly payments or want more financial flexibility, a 30-year mortgage could be the better option. Some financial experts recommend a compromise: taking a 30-year mortgage but making extra principal payments to reduce the overall loan term.\n",

While a 30-year mortgage can make your monthly payments more affordable, a 15-year mortgage generally costs less in the long run. Most homebuyers choose a 30-year home loan. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is practically an American archetype, the apple pie of financial instruments. It is the path that generations of Americans have taken to first-time homeownership. But many of those buyers might have been better served if they had opted for a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage instead. Though the monthly payments might be higher, they could save thousands in interest. ### Key Takeaways * Most homebuyers choose a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but a 15-year mortgage can be a good choice for some. * A 30-year mortgage can make your monthly payments more affordable. * While monthly payments on a 15-year mortgage are higher, the cost of the loan is less in the long run. ## How Mortgage Terms Affect Cost A mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mortgage.asp) is simply a particular type of term loan---one secured by real property. For a term loan, the borrower pays interest calculated on an annual basis against the outstanding balance of the loan. Both the [interest rate and monthly payment are fixed. Because the monthly payment is fixed, the portion going to pay interest and the portion going to pay principal change over time. In the beginning, because the loan balance is so high, most of the payment is interest. But as the balance gets smaller, the interest share of the payment declines, and the share going to principal increases. A shorter-term loan means a higher monthly payment, which makes the 15-year mortgage seem less affordable. But the shorter term makes the loan cheaper on several fronts.\n",

      "Chunk 2:  Of course, there's a catch. The price for saving so much money over the long run is a much higher monthly outlay---the payment on the hypothetical 15-year loan is $2,108, $676 (or about 38%) more than the monthly payment for the 30-year loan ($1,432). For some experts, being able to afford the higher payment includes having a rainy day fund tucked away. What many financial planners like about the 15-year mortgage is that it is effectively \"forced saving\". ### If an investor can afford the higher payment, it is in their interest to go with the shorter loan, especially if they are approaching retirement when they will be dependent on a fixed income. ## Special Considerations There are some instances where a borrower may have the incentive to invest the extra money spent each month on a 15-year mortgage elsewhere, such as in a 529 account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/529plan.asp) for college tuition or in a tax-deferred [401(k) plan, especially if the employer matches the borrower's contributions. And when mortgage rates are low, a savvy and disciplined investor could opt for the 30-year loan and place the difference between the 15-year and 30-year payments in higher-yielding securities. Using the previous example, if a 15-year loan monthly payment was $2,108, and the 30-year loan monthly payment was $1,432, a borrower could invest that $676 difference elsewhere. The back-of-the-envelope calculation is how much (or whether) the return on the outside investment, less the capital gains tax owed, exceeds the interest rate on the mortgage after accounting for the mortgage interest deduction. For someone in the 24% tax bracket, the deduction might reduce the effective mortgage interest rate from, for example, 4% to 3%. Broadly speaking, the borrower comes out ahead if the investment's returns after taxes are higher than the cost of the mortgage less the interest deduction. This gambit, however, demands a propensity for risk, according to Shashin Shah, a certified financial planner in Dallas, Texas, because the borrower will have to invest in volatile stocks. \"Currently there are no fixed-income investments that would yield a high enough return to make this work,\" says Shah. Rising mortgage rates can make this method even more difficult.\n",

      "Chunk 3:  The better choice is the one that works best with your finances and long-term goals. ## Is It Better to Get a 15-Year Mortgage or Make Extra Payments on a 30-Year Mortgage? Applying extra payments toward your principal can help you pay down a 30-year mortgage faster without being locked in to a 15-year time frame. Run the numbers to decide whether the flexibility will be worth it, since 30-year loans often come with higher interest rates. ## Is It Worth It to Switch From a 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgage to a 15-Year? If you already have a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and are interested in refinancing to a 15-year mortgage, there are a couple key points to keep in mind. First, consider whether your budget can accommodate the higher mortgage payment of a 15-year loan. Then, compare your existing interest rate with the rates you qualify for on a 15-year mortgage. If you can get a lower interest rate, that could save you money. But with a refinance, you also have to consider the costs of the new loan, which could include origination fees, closing costs, and other expenses. If you don't come out ahead after factoring in the new interest rate as well as the costs of the new loan, you might choose to make extra payments on your existing loan instead. ## The Bottom Line The decision between a 30-year or 15-year mortgage is one that will impact your finances for decades to come, so be sure to crunch the numbers before deciding which is best. If your aim is to pay off the mortgage sooner and you can afford higher monthly payments, a 15-year loan might be a better choice. The lower monthly payment of a 30-year loan, on the other hand, may allow you to buy more house or free up funds for other financial goals.
